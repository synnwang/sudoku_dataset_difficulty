# A Dataset of Sudoku Puzzles with Difficulty Metrics by Human Players
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game all around the world.
Difficulty rating of a Sudoku puzzle is a  difficult problem and a large number of researches have been proposed to tackle the problem.
How to evaluate a difficulty rating algorithm is also a challenging problem.
Different algorithms evaluate their performances by using different datasets.
Furthermore,  some datasets are not based on the records played by human players.
Therefore,  the algorithms can not be compared and improved.
In this paper,  we construct a dataset of Sudoku puzzles with difficulty metrics experienced by human players.
We first developed an Android application named Cloud Sudoku to collect the raw data.
Two difficulty metrics are then proposed for each Sudoku puzzle based on the duration spent and the ratio which is successfully solved.
A dataset of Sudoku puzzles with their difficulty metrics is designed and constructed.
The proposed dataset can be used to evaluate the difficulty rating algorithms.

### Difficulty Metrics
* $D_{TO}$: Considers playing time in solving a Sudoku game only
* $D_{TR}$: Considers playing time and the completion rate both

### The Datasets
* 20240415.csv: The data with two difficulty metrics
* sudoku_records_20250407.xls: The data with sudoku problems with number of players completing it and average solving time in seconds
